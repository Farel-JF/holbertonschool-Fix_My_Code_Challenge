Fix My Code Challenge
Description
The Fix My Code Challenge is a project where we dive into existing codebases and identify errors or bugs to fix. The primary objective is to understand the code, debug it, and provide the necessary fixes without rewriting the entire implementation. The languages and files vary, including Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and C.

This project is optional and not mandatory, but participating will boost your project grade significantly. It’s designed to help us learn debugging skills by working on real-world issues.

Project Structure
This repository contains different directories and files, each corresponding to different tasks that need debugging:

FizzBuzz

File: 0-fizzbuzz.py
Issue: 15 should print "FizzBuzz", but currently only prints "Fizz".
Language: Python
Print Square

File: 1-print_square.js
Issue: Printing a square of a given size is not working properly.
Language: JavaScript
Sort

File: 2-sort.rb
Issue: Sorting logic for arguments isn’t correct.
Language: Ruby
User Password

File: 3-user.py
Issue: User password validation is broken.
Language: Python
Double Linked List

File: 4-delete_dnodeint/
Issue: Deleting nodes in a doubly linked list isn’t functioning as expected.
Language: C
Requirements
Editors: vi, vim, or emacs
Compilation: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Every file should end with a new line.
A mandatory README.md is required at the root of the project folder.
