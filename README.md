Fix My Code
Overview
Fix My Code is an engaging project where you'll dive into existing codebases to identify and correct issues. This initiative focuses on refining and debugging pre-written code, rather than starting from scratch. The goal is to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the provided code samples.

Project Background
This project invites you to explore a repository named Fix_My_Code_Challenge. Your task is to address and rectify issues in the provided code files. These files are designed to have intentional bugs or inefficiencies that need fixing. The challenge helps you improve your debugging skills and gain a deeper understanding of code maintenance.

Note: Participation in this project is optional. However, completing any part of it can positively influence your project grade, potentially raising your average if you perform well. If your current average is higher than your score on this project, it might lower your average, but it’s a valuable opportunity to learn and grow.

Requirements
General
Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compilation Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
File Endings: Ensure all your files end with a new line.
README.md: A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository containing the code samples:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fix_My_Code_Challenge.git
Navigate to the Directory

Change into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Fix_My_Code_Challenge
Review the Code

Open the files provided and identify areas where the code needs fixing. Pay attention to comments, errors, or any output mismatches.

Apply Fixes

Correct the identified issues in the code. Ensure that your changes are tested and that the code behaves as expected.

Document Your Changes

Update this README file or add comments to the code explaining the changes made and the reasons behind them.

Example
If you encounter a script that’s intended to sort a list of numbers but has errors, your task would be to debug and correct the sorting algorithm to ensure it sorts the numbers correctly. You might also need to ensure that input validation and output formatting are handled properly.

Conclusion
This project is a practical way to enhance your coding and debugging skills. Dive in, explore the code, and have fun fixing the bugs!
