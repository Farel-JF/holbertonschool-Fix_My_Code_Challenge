Fix My Code Challenge
Welcome to the Fix My Code Challenge repository! This repository contains solutions to various coding problems including implementations of a double linked list, FizzBuzz in Python, and more.

Directory Structure
challenge/
Contains C source files for the double linked list implementation and related functionalities.
fizzbuzz/
Contains a Python script for solving the FizzBuzz problem.
print_square/
Contains a Node.js script for printing a square with #.
Files
C Source Code
main.c
Main file that runs the double linked list operations.

free_dlistint.c
Implementation of the function to free the doubly linked list.

print_dlistint.c
Implementation of the function to print the doubly linked list.

add_dnodeint_end.c
Implementation of the function to add a node at the end of the doubly linked list.

delete_dnodeint_at_index.c
Implementation of the function to delete a node at a specific index in the doubly linked list.

lists.h
Header file defining the doubly linked list structure and function prototypes.

Python Script
fizzbuzz.py
Python script that prints numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".
Node.js Script
print_square.js
Node.js script that prints a square of # characters. The size of the square is provided as a command line argument.
Usage
C Code Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the C code:

bash
Copy code
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 challenge/main.c challenge/free_dlistint.c challenge/print_dlistint.c challenge/add_dnodeint_end.c challenge/delete_dnodeint_at_index.c -o delete_dnodeint
./delete_dnodeint
Python Script Execution
To run the FizzBuzz script:

bash
Copy code
python3 fizzbuzz.py <number>
Replace <number> with the integer up to which you want to print the FizzBuzz sequence.

Node.js Script Execution
To run the Node.js script:

bash
Copy code
node print_square.js <size>
Replace <size> with the size of the square you want to print.

Testing
For testing the Python and Node.js scripts, simply execute them with different command line arguments and verify the output matches the expected results.

Contributing
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the code or add new features.
